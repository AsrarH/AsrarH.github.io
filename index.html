        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Asrar!</h1>
				<p>I have a strong interest in computer science algorithms and have worked in a variety of aspects. I began my journey with programming IOS applications. Afterwards I expanded my programming skills to the back and front end systems, but I still haven't completely satisfied my aspirations to innovate. As a result, I found my interest in research! My main focus areas are artificial intelligence and computer vision. At Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, I majored in Computer Vision. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
